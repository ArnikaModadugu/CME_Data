# CME DATA ELT & Visualization

## Overview

This project streamlines the Extract, Load, Transform (ELT) process for CME agriculture instrument data stored in Azure Blob Storage. By employing Snowflake, DBT (Data Build Tool), and Tableau, this workflow facilitates efficient data processing and visualization, enhancing decision-making capabilities.

## Features

- **Azure Blob Storage Extraction**: Data is extracted from Azure Blob Storage, ensuring a reliable source of raw data.

- **Streaming Data Load to Snowflake**: Utilizing efficient chunk-by-chunk streaming, data is seamlessly loaded from Azure Blob Storage to Snowflake, optimizing resource utilization.

- **Data Transformation with DBT**: DBT performs comprehensive data transformation, including cleaning and dimensional modeling, ensuring data accuracy and relevance.

- **Integration with Tableau**: Snowflake is connected to Tableau, enabling the creation of dynamic visualizations and reports based on transformed data, including insights derived from CME agriculture instrument data.
